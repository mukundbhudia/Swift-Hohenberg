Swift-Hohenberg
===============

Project Title: 
Numerical determination of solutions of the (driven, heterogeneous) conserved Swift-Hohenberg equation and of their linear stability - an integrative computational approach

Description:
The project concerns the analysis of the (driven, heterogeneous) conserved
Swift-Hohenberg equation (for homogeneous and inhomogeneous media). This
is a sixth order partial differential equation that is related to
recent developments in several areas, e.g., some of its variants are
employed as phase field crystal models. The project mainly concerns
the analysis of steady state solutions of the equation, and their relation to the 
effect of depinning.
